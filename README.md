Redis Scanner
=====================

Redis scanner is an utility to sample and visualise keys in your Redis instance.

Using it is pretty straightforward, run it using:

`./redis-scanner.js`

This will start a webserver on port 8079, and you can connect to it using
your web browser, where you'll be able to specify address and port of the actual
Redis host.
